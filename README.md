Reads in file produced by Schwinn stationary bike.
Currently, this is configured to read a file from /volumes/AARON/AARON1.DAT from a usb thumb drive. 
You may need to change this based on where your file is located and what it has been named.  

I created this b/c Schwinn discontinued their original site that displayed this data.

## Historical Graphs
![Historical Graphs](/images/HistoricalData.png)

Once the file is read, you will get 2 sets of graphs (you will need to move graph 2 to see graph 1). The 1st set shows you your historical values for:
 - Workout Time
 - Distance
 - Average Speed

## Graphs for last 30 days
![Past 30 Days](/images/Last30days.png)

Once you close those graphs, you will get 2 additional graphs (Graph 2 is on top of graph 1) with the same data for the last 30 days.

## Display of all data
Once you close those graphs, you will see a print out of all your past data points.
